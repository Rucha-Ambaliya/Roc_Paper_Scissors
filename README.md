# Rock_Paper_Scissors

Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors game project! ðŸŽ®

## Overview
This is a simple frontend project of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The layout of the project is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using viewport units (vw, vh, vmin). This game keeps track of the marks gained by the user and the computer and displays it on the screen and the game will reset when either the player or the computer reaches a score of 20.
